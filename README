This is an experiment to see if we can find characteristcs of tweets that:

* We can summarise easily
* That correlate with the truthfulness of the tweet

=Assumptions=

We've taken a few intial (debatable) assumptions:

* Number of retweets can go either way. It could mean that it's true, or 
false but shocking, amongst other things. But it still seesm like an 
important piece of information.

* High speed of retweeting probably indicates RT without thinking - I've 
termed this 'velocity' and we find it using a search and comparing the 
first and last times within the 15 default available. High speed in this 
sense is 15 in less than 30 minutes, totally arbitrarily.

* Supporting material is a good thing. It can still be lies but 
especially when you don't know someone, 'pix (or video) or it didn't 
happen' applies. We've just taken a few of the typical services people 
use for shaing video and pictures on Twitter - yfrog, twitpic, flickr, 
tweetvid or youtube.

* Finally for now, we try to determine if the person's tweet url you 
entered was by the original tweeter. This makes a difference if you are 
looking for eye witness evidence.


=Logging=

We log all the actions taken at the bottom of the page so you can see 
what's going on.
